# GameHer
[Gameher.fr](https://gameher.fr/) is a french association aspiring to develop gender diversity in the fields of video games, esport and streaming. It is run by [a great team of volunteers](https://gameher.fr/team/a-propos) with the goal of developing a healthy environment for all players.

### Setup

Clone the project and install its dependencies:
```
composer install
npm install
```

Copy the `.env.dist` file in a new `.env` file, and configure it according to your environment:

- **APP_ENV**: Symfony env, usually `dev` or `prod`
- **APP_SECRET**: Your secret
- **DATABASE_URL**: url to connect to your database
- **OAUTH_DISCORD_ID**: Required for OAuth, get it from Discord (see [configuring Discord](#configuring-discord))
- **OAUTH_DISCORD_SECRET**:  Required for OAuth, get it from Discord (see [configuring Discord](#configuring-discord))

Create your database and run migrations
```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

That's it, you are ready

### Develop

If you use the [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) you can launch a development server with `symfony server:start`, otherwise you need to configure your Apache installation to serve the files from the `public` folder.
You can then launch the webpack server with a watcher by running `npm run watch`

Then head over to http://localhost:3000 (with Symfony CLI) or to your webserver to start working

You can run the application with Docker:  
Clone the repo and run `make install`  
This will setup the docker images, install the dependencies and run the migrations  
You can then run `npm install` and `npm run dev` at the root of the repository in order to install and compile assets.  
You might need to setup your hosts to redirect `gameher.dev` to localhost  

After this first installation, you can boot up the docker containers by simply running `make up`  
Log into the different containers by running `make tty` for the symfony container and `make db` for the mariadb container  
Recompile the front assets with `make assets`  
Stop the containers with `make stop`  


### Configuring Discord

The app uses Discord's OAuth server to handle user. In order to login and access the admin panel, you need to configure a Discord app.

Head over to [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and create a **New Application** and fill its name
On the *General Information* tab, you can retrieve the client ID and client Secret that you need to add to your `.env` file
On the *OAuth2* tab, click on **Add Redirect** and enter the app's redirect url. The format will be:
`http://YOUR_APP_URL/connect/discord/check
`
In the scopes section, select `identify`, `email` and `connections`

Finally, **Save Changes** ! You can now log into the app

### PHP Extensions

`sudo apt-get install php7.3 php7.3-cli php7.3-common php7.3-fpm php7.3-mysql php7.3-intl php7.3-curl  php7.3-zip php7.3-xml`
